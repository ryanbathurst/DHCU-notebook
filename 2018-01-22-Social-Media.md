## Black Lives Matter 
- Can it really facilitate change: Metoo 
- Depending on the encompassing network of actors that engage with the concept - move beyond simple recognition 
- It is not just the humans who have agency on social media 
- Are algorithms considered non-human actors? Facebook algorithms - human is pulling the lever but the algorithm decides when to block a women breat feeding because it categorizes it as pornography. 
- Reproduces and reduces hierarchies - more contextual than anything 
- Providing information vs providing knowledge 
- Do algorithms on facebook even mimic the real world? promoting things we like in place of things that contend 
- Network analysis - do further reading 
- Sometimes you need to search out the opinions that are counter to yours. 

## Surveillance 
- When you start to write a post and delete it - they also keep that...
- When we agree to the terms and conditions we sacrifice our privacy 
- China - social media score - put on job applications and dating sites - carries a similar weight to that of a credit score 
- Who gets to do the monitoring? 
- The fundamental ethics of social media = attention economy. 

## Value Making 
- Respectful listening - can't be seen but sometimes it is the best way to start an engagement with something 
- Knowledge production - legitimacy and likes 
- a question of power

Social Actors 

- author: actively sharing new content or starting a conversatino 
- Commentators/ Distributors : retweets, echo 'other user's original thoughts' 
- Trolls: clear intent, autonomous 
- Bots: intents are vague 
- General public: influenced easily, structured 
- Affective Economy (Ahmed) - the sharing of far right, anti-muslim videos grants legitimacy to those beliefs within the discursive field
- Intertwined with so many other issues - acceleration of exposure. 
- Documenting the Now - ethical collection
