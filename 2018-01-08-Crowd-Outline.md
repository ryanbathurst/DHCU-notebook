## Understanding the Crowd

### Defining a Crowd 
 
A crowd should be a fairly straight foward concept for most readers. When picturing one, we most likely imagine a physical space packed with a high volume of human beings jostling for position or just waiting in line. This collection of people, usually has a reason to be where they are, whether its to vote in an election or participate in a town hall meatting. This image of a crowd is certainly a valid interpretation if we are thinking about crowds in a purely physical, geographically located context. When we extend the idea of the crowd however, into the realm of the digital, the definition of a crowd appears to broaden. What may be of use here is to consider the digital crowd as a public or public(s). To illustrate this idea, Jeff Howe (2006), in "The Rise of Crowdsourcing" draws on number of crowdsourced projects. While not the most academically relevant example, the VH1 television program, *Web Junk 20*, is a useful example of how the labour and product of others, in the case an anonymous public, is repurposed for the benefit of another party. The primary actors involved, in this case amateur photographers and VH1 employees, are in an unequal relationship when it comes to the benefits produced by the show. Drawing the content for the program from the internet, the producers were able to bypass the usual costs associated with licensing and filming. What faciliated this you might ask? The parent company of VH1, Viacom, had acquired the video sharing website iFilm which most of us don't recognize as a result of the dominance of Youtube. Drawing on the viral videos found on iFilm, MTV was able to produce a telivision program that relied almost entirely on the production of others. While *Crowd Junk 2.0* demonstrates the way that the power of crowds can be harnessed for mundane purposes, it is a useful example to help convey how technology has transfored the way individuals can be engaged, the way new projects can be structured, and the way individuals or groups interact. It should also be noted that while this particular television program was organized around the producers of the show, many crowdsourced programs are more collaborative and less one sided in their benefits. 


### Digital Communities?

In exploring what it means to be a member of a digital community or to contribute to a collaborative project, trying to understand the ‘digital space’ can be a challenge. As discussed by Bridget Draxler and Jon Winet in ["'Community’ Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities"](https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/keywords/community/) the term digital community on its own is a complicated term to come to grips with. The fluid and temporal nature of online interactions for example, does away with the physical space that usually serves as the meeting place.To help refine our understanding of this issue it is beneficial to look at it from a sociological perspective. In particualr it might be useful to refer to Erving Goffman’s theory of the interaction order and the presentation of self to understand how a concept like digital community can exist. Unlike face to face interactions which require the actor to be in the other participant’s response presence, digital or mediated interaction allows the actors to meet exclusively in time. The absence of the physical, while complicating the process of mutual monitoring, liberates actors from the physical space they find themselves in. A digital community then, is a community of actors who do not have to share any specific geographical location, but rather, share a set of values, beliefs, or commitments. As noted by Draxler and Winet (    ), the communities that emerge in this digital 'space' are the most effective when they emerge out of local communities. While this may be true, many communities have formed online that do not have their roots in a physical community, we should be careful not to limit the range of possibilies offorded by digital 'spaces'. Looking at the case of Wikipedia for example, the community of contributors, editors, and administrators are actively constructing a digital space where individuals interact. The changes that are made to articles and the sometimes heated discussions that ensue are part of a process of community building which did not have it's origins in a local, physical community. Even though most users of Wikipedia do not make changes to the articles, they benefit from the work of a group or community of users. The democratic approach fosters a sense of connectedness and promotes an investment in the product.

### Digital Crowds?

  To extend the definition of the crowd, it is worth noting that not all crowds are communities. While the term 'community' implies a kind of active participation towards a defined goal, the crowd is a less cohesive entity. If you find your self walking down a busy street in New York City with pedestrians on all sides, you wouldn't necessarily consider yourself to be a community. The individuals that you find yourself moving along with are not moving towards the same destination and they don't have the same motivation for being there. Under normal conditions, this collection of bodies is likely to go about their daly routine without much complication. However, while this collection of people doesn't share a set of specific goals or values, they might be considered part of a larger community of New York City commuters. I'm not trying to intentionally complicate our understanding of crowds and communities but it seems like the wherever crowds are present, the possibility for a communities to emerge increases. This doesn't mean the individuals on the streets are consciouslly aware of their shared interest, but in the event of a possible obstruction to their commute, they may be made aware of their alliance. In additon, store owners and street vednors may also align with the interests of the commuters, further expanding the size of the 'community'. As many scholars like Draxler and Winet have pointed out, community is not exactly the most conscise term, much like 'identity', and it can come to represent a wide away of things. To be fair, I'm using a lose definition of 'community' but in todays digital environment, a loose definition is best kind to accomodate the fluidity of online life. 

## Why go the way of the Crowd?

To understand how crowds can be powerful tools in the digital age, *Web Junk 2.0* aside, we need only take a closer look at the case of Wikipedia. While encyclopedia writing has traditionally been a professional and solitary endeavor, the introduction of Wikipedia into the the field certainly challenged that established norm. With over 40 million articles  availble online in 299 languages, Wikipedia has opened the door to not just to amateur historians, but to enthusiastic users who have something to say, often about topics that have been negelected by academic writers. While this may have intially seemed like a questionable decision, Wikipedia has grown into to one of the most consulted and, if I may be so bold, a fairly reliable online source. However, without getting into a discussion of what 'good' historical writting looks like, what we should recognize at this point is that opening up projects to the public can yield amazing results. In contrast to the intial project *Nupedia* oriented towards scholars and academics, *Wikipedia's* success can be traced to it's accessibility and collaborative nature. Unlike many other online encyclopedias, *Wikipedia* is entirely free to use and contribute to.

As noted by Roy Rosenzweig in ["Can History be Open Source? Wikipedia and the Future of the Past"](http://chnm.gmu.edu/essays-on-history-new-media/essays/?essayid=42), *Wikipedia* compares favourably to encyclopedia's like *Encarta* and *American National Biography Online* when looking at the length and number of articles published from a sample of biographies. Despite having fewer entries than *American National Biography Online*, Wikipedia was found to have more entries that *Encarta*. Looking at the number of errors, *Wikipedia* also matches *Encarta* in terms of the number of errors found in articles. While this places Wikipedia somewhere in the middle in terms of it's quality of writing, what we need to understand is the diversity of content found on the site. Rather than reproduce the same articles found in other encyclopedias, drawing from crowds allows for the creation of content that more accurately reflects the interests of the public(s). As discussed by Jack Dougherty and Kristen Nawrotzki in "Writing History in the Digital Age" (2013), Wikipedia serves a space where traditional assumptions about historical writing clash with popular memory and the interests of the average person. Similar to the larger open access movement occuring in the digital humanities and academia, the 'crowds' that usually get relegated to the sidelines are now occuping a larger role in content production. This of course occaisionally raises questions of ownership, as will be demonstrated in our discussion of labour, but crucially, drawing on 'crowds' helps to create a more inclusive space. 

## Labour 
As with most great technological advancements, the internet has had a powerful impact on the way that western society in particular now conducts daily interactions and work. Looking at the case of [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) the web service asserts that it provides a way of avoiding the undesireable task of having to hire large and costly temporary workers. How does it get around this problem for it's users? Well, in a nutshell, Amazon Mechanical Turk allows companies to access a vast network of global laborers with the intention of using their human intelligence skills or HITs. While this certainly helps to keep costs for the companies low, the cost to the laborers is something that isn't given equal weight. In contrast to the idealic image painted by Amazon, there are a number of issues relating to the use of a massive 24/7 on demand labour foce. One of the most glaring flaws in this design is the fact that most tasks, like identifying objects in images for example, offers miniscule wages in return. As demonstrated by Trebot Scholz in "Crowdmilking" (2014), this practice is not limited to Amazon Mechanical Turk, but is occupying an increasingly relevant place in the contemporary labour market. 

 In discussing 'crowdmilking' Trebor Sholz points out that around 10 million people are currently working in the crowdsourcing field (2014). This is number is further expanded if we take into consideration that approximately 42 million freelancers working in the United States who do not have consistent employment. Part of the issue when looking at the use of 'crowds' is that in contrast to the everyday 9-4 job, the work being done for AMT and similar crowdsourcing companies does not come with benefits, offers low wages, and is often lacking any kind of regulated work hours. Touching on the Australian design compancy 99Designs, Sholz highlights the issues that surround this approach to labour. With 200,000 designers currently registered to the company, the production of something like a logo is able to be assigned to any number of designers who then have to invest their time and energy into the creation of a new logo. While the company paying for the new logo may offer a few hundred dollars to 99Designs, only the designer who's logo is chosen will be paid. Considering the fact that up to 100 designers can compete for one contract, the amount of waster labour starts to become apparant. 
 
 Returning to Amazon Mechanical Turk, it is also important to note that many labourers do not know who they are working for or how their labour or products will be used. This compartmentalization is a major component in crowdsourcing labour. When looking to complete a task that might take one person days or even weeks to complete, AMT can higher a larger work force to complete small portions of the larger job. This obviously requires a less skilled labour force and one which is willing to complete a high volume of tasks for a small profit. One of the consequences of structuring labour in this fashion is that traditional credentials and knowledge gets devalued in place of cheap and efficient crowdsourcing. To demonstrate just how cheap this labour is, Sholz 

## Academia 

Approaching crowds from a slightly different angle, Hong-Ming Liang (2013), in "Opening the Journal: How an Open-Access E-Journal Can Serve Scholarship, the Liberal Arts, and the Community" highlights the ways that collaborative and open scholarly work can extend beyond the walls of universities. Discussing the *Middle Ground Journal: World History and Global Studies*, Liang identifies three factors that contribute to the success of the journal. The first of these is the participation of undergraduate students which often takes the form of shadowing editors or recommending literature to be reviewed. Arriving from diverse academic backgrounds, the undergraduate participants are given the opportunity to engage not only with the peer review elements of the journal, but are given the chance to work on social media, marketing, and other digital projects. These undergraduate interns are also able to work alongside secondary school geography and history teachers which is the second factor that helps to bring the journal into the community.The third and final factor, unlike the previous two, has to do with the way information is presented to non-academic audiences. Liang notes that in dealing with the public, newer forms of scholarship are need and so reflective essays, podcasts, and interviews have become alternatives to the essays and articles that would otherwise remain outside of public view. A major reason behind this push to engage with the public and secondary schools in particular is the desire to see the Liberal Arts and higher education in general as a viable pathway for all. Bridging the gap between secondary schools and academia through participation in National History Day projects for example, not only makes the liberal arts more relevant to students lives, but helps to strengthen the research skills of the students.  

## Crowdsourced Projects

1.Wikipedia 

As has already been discussed, Wikipedia is one of the most succesfull and commonly cited examples of a crowdsourced project. 
Regarding the quality of the writing on Wikipedia pages, it is sometimes obvious that articles are not written by professional writers. However, while the quality of the writing might not be on par with the articles in professionally written encyclopedias, they have the potential to offer knowledge to a wider audience. Importantly, as noted by Rosenzweig (2006), the articles that contain the most errors are typically the newest ones but the quality of the writing increases as more contributors make changes to the articles. With this in mind, while the best resources are not always available to the public, Wikipedia offers a fairly reliable source of information. As a resource it is beneficial to public education even if it contains occasional errors and bias, perhaps warranting a reconsideration of what it means to write ‘good history’. Not only should we reconsider what it means to write history, but we should think about the ways bad/not so good historical writing can shed light on existing issues. By looking at bias in historical writing for example we can sometimes gain insights into different perspectives or what Durkheim referred to as ‘social facts’. The emphasis that gets placed on key events and historical figures has the potential to reveal new information about historical memory, political orientations, etc.
