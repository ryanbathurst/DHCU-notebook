# Crowds 

## Understanding the Crowd

### Defining a crowd 
 
A crowd should be a fairly straight foward concept for most readers. When picturing one, we most likely imagine a physical space packed with a high volume of human beings, jostling for position or just waiting in line. This is certainly a valid interpretation if we are thinking about crowds in a purely physical, geographically located context. When we extend the idea of the crowd however, into the realm of the digital, the definition of a crowd appears to broaden. What may be of use here, is to consider the digital crowd, as a public or public(s). To illustrate this idea, Jeff Howe (2006), in "The Rise of Crowdsourcing" draws on number of crowdsourced projects. While not the most academically relevant example, the VH1 television program, *Web Junk 20*, is a useful example of how the labour and product of others, in the case the public, is put to work for the benefit of another party. The primary actors involved, in this case amateur (photographers)and VH1 employees, are in an unequal relationship when it comes to the benefits produced by the show. Drawing the content for the program from the internet, the producers were able to bypass the usual costs associated with licensing and/or filming. What faciliated this you might ask? The parent company of VH1, Viacom, had acquired the video sharing website iFilm which most of us don't recognize as a result of the dominance of Youtube. Drawing on the viral videos found on iFilm, MTV was able to produce a telivision program that relied almost entirely on the productions of others. As far as this program relates to our discusssion of crowds, it should be apparant that modern technology has transfored the way individuals can be engaged, the way labour can be structured, and the way individuals or groups interact. 

### Digital communities?

In exploring what it means to be a member of a digital community or to contribute to a collaborative project, trying to understand the ‘digital space’ can be a challenge. As discussed by Bridget Draxler and Jon Winet in ["'Community’ Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities"](https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/keywords/community/) the term digital community on its own is a complicated term to come to grips with. The fluid and temporal nature of online interactions for example, does away with the physical space that usually serves as the meeting place.To help refine our understanding of this issue it is beneficial to look at it from a sociological perspective. In particualr it might be useful to refer to Erving Goffman’s theory of the interaction order to understand how a concept like digital community can exist. Unlike face to face interactions which require the actor to be in the other participant’s response presence, digital or mediated interaction allows the actors to meet exclusively in time. The absence of the physical, while complicating the process of mutual monitoring, liberates actors from the physical space they find themselves in. A digital community then, is a community of actors who do not have to share any specific geographical location, but rather, share a set of values, beliefs, or commitments. As noted by Draxler and Winet, the communities that emerge in this digital 'space' are the most effective when they emerge out of local communities. While this may be true, many communities have formed online that do not have their roots in a physical community, we should be careful not to limit the range of possibilies offorded by digital 'spaces'. Looking at the case of Wikipedia for example, the community of contributors, editors, and administrators are actively constructing a digital space where individuals interact. The changes that are made to articles and the sometimes heated discussions that ensue are part of a process of community building which did not have it's origins in a local, physical community. Even though most users of Wikipedia do not make changes to the articles, they benefit from the work of a group or community of users. The democratic approach fosters a sense of connectedness and promotes an investment in the product.

## Why go the way of the Crowd?

To understand how crowds can be powerful tools in the digital age, *Web Junk 20* and *Tosh 2.0* aside, we need only take a closer look at the case of Wikipedia. While encyclopedia writing has traditionally been a professional and solitary endeavor, the introduction of Wikipedia into the the field certainly challenged that established norm. With over 3 million articles  availble online, Wikipedia has opened the door to not just to amateur historians, but to enthusiastic users who have something to say, often about topics that have been negelected by academic writers. While this may have intially seemed like a questionable decision, Wikipedia has grown into to one of the most consulted and, if I may be so bold, a fairly reliable online source. However, without getting into a discussion of what 'good' historical writting looks like, what we should recognize at this point is that opening up projects to the public can yield amazing results. In contrast to the intial project *Nupedia* oriented towards scholars and academics,

## Labour 
As with most great technological advancements, the internet has had a powerful impact on the way that western society in particular now conduct daily interactions and work. Looking at the case of [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) the web service asserts that it provides a way of avoiding the undesireable task of having to hire large and costly temporary workers. How does it get around this problem for it's users? Well, in a nutshell, Amazon Mechanical Turk allows companies to access a vast network of global laborers with the intention of using their human intelligence skills or HITs. While this certainly helps to keep costs for the companies low, the cost to the laborers is something that isn't given equal weight. In contrast to the idealic image painted by Amazon, there are a number of issues relating to the use of a massive on demand labour foce. One of the most glaring flaws in this design is the fact that most tasks, like identifying objects in images for example, offer miniscule wages in return. As demonstrated by Trebot Scholz, this practice is not limited to Amazon Mechanical Turk, but is occupying an increasingly relevant place in the contemporary labour market. 

Scale: 
- 10 million people plus the 42 million freelacers and interns in the United States alone. 
- 24/7 - constant access to a work force that 
- does not have to comply with any kind of labour standards, the advancements made on behalf of the 8 hour work day have no weight or significance in the area of crowd sources.

## Crowdsourced Projects

1.Wikipedia 
- Discussion of what it mean to write 'good' history? 
- What information do we find in Wikipedia that might be missing or lacking in other, more traditional sources?
- Does the crowd offer wisdom?

Regarding the quality of the writing on Wikipedia pages, it is sometimes obvious that articles are not written by professional writers. However, while the quality of the writing might not be on par with the articles in professionally written encyclopedias, they have the potential to offer knowledge to a wider audience. Importantly, as noted by Rosenzweig (2006), the articles that contain the most errors are typically the newest ones but the quality of the writing increases as more contributors make changes to the articles. With this in mind, while the best resources are not always available to the public, Wikipedia offers a fairly reliable source of information. As a resource it is beneficial to public education even if it contains occasional errors and bias, perhaps warranting a reconsideration of what it means to write ‘good history’. Not only should we reconsider what it means to write history, but we should think about the ways bad/not so good historical writing can shed light on existing issues. By looking at bias in historical writing for example we can sometimes gain insights into different perspectives or what Durkheim referred to as ‘social facts’. The emphasis that gets placed on key events and historical figures has the potential to reveal new information about historical memory, political orientations, etc.
