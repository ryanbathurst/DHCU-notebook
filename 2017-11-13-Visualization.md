## Notes on Vizualization 

Definition: the representation of data in visual form to display information 

- Is everything data? 
- Can everything be represented as data? 
- Data visualization as a way of telling the story back to yourself - seeing what you missed 
- Mapping- the act of locating concepts within or in relation to other concepts 
- De-formation: power in the ability to take apart (make it strange in order to know it agian)- present something common in an uncommon way 
- deform what is there (snippets and pieces) in order to put it back together.
