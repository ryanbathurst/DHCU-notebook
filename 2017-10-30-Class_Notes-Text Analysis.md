### What is text analysis?

- The process of identifying patterns and trends in a given set of recorded data with the application of computational tools or by conventional close reading practices or through a comibination of both. 
- Close Reading:does the work a computer cannot do... more subjective and offers a deeper comprehension of language. 
- Distant Reading: Does work a human cannot do, more 'objective'... semantic language comprehension.
- Can distant reading be objective if the parameters of work done by the tool is dictated by us, the users?
