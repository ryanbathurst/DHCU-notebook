## Notes open source code.

When reading Eric Steven Raymond's "The Cathedral and the Bazar" one of the things I was struck by was the similarity between open source coding and the way actor network theory operates. Raymond speeks of coproducers and a large user base throughout the text. In the context of actor network theory a large base of users or actants is essential in the transition from a weak concept to a strong/dominant one. The code in this case needs to adopted by users in order to move from a weak, possibly bug riddled concept to a strong/dominant one. The users can be considered as actants in the development of what Steven Ward refers to as an encompassing network. As Raymond highlights, users can lead to the development and improvement of the code. If there idea behind Raymonds project was not useful it would have found a smaller user base, but with a large and active user base, the ideas he is working with gain weight and what Steven Ward might consider "truthfullness". 

Similarly, the code Raymond was working with had its origin in existing programing languages (as I understand it) which means that he is also lending weight to the existing language. The move from a narrow user base to a broad encompassing network of users makes a claim about the applicable nature of the existing language. Once it is taken out of it's original context and applied to a new project, it gains more weight. The true test of how strong of a netowrk such a concept or idea will have comes when it is used in the broader public domain. It moves from a narrow base of experts, to a slightly larger base of coproducers, before being picked up by the public, who whether they are aware of it or not, solidify the concept.
