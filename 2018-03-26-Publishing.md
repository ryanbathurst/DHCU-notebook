## Publishing (An unethical practice)

How has publishing involved in the digital era? 

What is publishing? 
- dissemination of information 
- anyone can do it - credibility is no longer assumed (authority)
- filter/publish vs publish/filter
- Taylor and Francis 
- Spectrum of publishing 
- where does social media fit into this picture? Do we consider twitter to be a site for publishing? 
- the reader is often not considered when it comes to publishing. 

Anxiety of publishing 
- anyone can go online and publish which raises a lot of important questions 
- problematic for users or readers who do not have the literacy skills to identify bias and poor quality works. 

Middle Ground Journal 
- allows for the inclusion of younger scholars - still has review and filter process but still opens up the process.
- similarities in music - perhaps there is a model that can be adapted for publishing written works? Think of Radiohead's _In Rainbows_ or The Guardian's donation strategy  
- capitalist nature of publishing - univeristy publishing 
- In scholarly work the fear is less about having a material product, instead the anxieties that surface relate to reputation (reputational economy). "It's in _Nature_ it must be good". 
- open access repositories - allowed to keep original copy.

Escaping the confines of the Page
- writing with a word processor has allowed for a more non-linear and open experience. 
- open data vs linked data (data as a competitive advantage)
- the increasingly active reader (productive vs destructive conversation)
- reading and writing, as processes, are not as seperate as they have been in the past. 
- self-publishing on Amazon for example (Kindle/Amazon) - minimal filtering. 
- Non-academic publishing - fanfiction - opens up the possibility of a community approach to editing - commentary from the reader can be incorporated into the text. 
- Instagram poetry (what starts out as open can later be turned to profit) 

Interactive Fiction (non-linear)
- active participation on the part of the reader 
- similar to an adventure game but interface is text only  (some control over narrative) 
- few venues for interactive fiction  (gate keeping).

Lets Explore Riverdale 
- what is the point or role of a publisher in this case?

- orignally the internet was suppose to be a place where a browser served as a kind of a blog (pulling things together). Now we have centralized control and passive reception. The underlying infrastructure still has the possibility of creative output.
