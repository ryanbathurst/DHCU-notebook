# Notes 
- Coding is hieratic (the thing of priests) 
- Gate keeping - reflects power sturcutures 
- Netlogo - targets simulations (non-linear systems) 
- Digital Native myth - leaves open the door to a lack of education about digital literacy 
- Coding allows for the creation of different realities 


# Provacative Things 
- Data and code is everywhere and yet most of us are still unaware of how they operate. It connects to the magical qualities of technologies. If we don't know how it works we risk unforseen consequences, as demonstrated in the recent 2016 elections. NEWSFEED
