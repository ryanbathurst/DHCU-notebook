## Accessibility

General Terms 
- Ease of access 
- Assistive technology 
- Visual, auditory, motor, speech, 
- Visible and cognitive 

Digital Terms 
- Assistive technologies/ adaptive technologies. 
- Interoperability 
- Availability accross platforms and devices. 
- Usability 
- Context specific issues 

### Biases and Stereotypes
Doing things in a different way is one of the possible ways of framing disability. 

Adaptive - technology that sits on top of other technology

Assistive - ability to perform tasks with abilities they already have (tend to be more bias towards this) 

### Accessibility in Public Spaces 
- Accessibility = retrofit 
- Online spaces as public spaces - digital environments (ex: Government of Canada)
- Citizen engagement - reluctant to engage in process of accessibility - speaks to the albeism that permeats western culutre. Employemt rates are lower, disengages citizens from participating in other activities. 
- Outsider/insider status - othering and the process of integration 

### Academia 
- Plain language 
- Contruction of social idenity 
- Language can be used to avoid further explanation 
- Dominat narratives in academia vs marginal narratives 

### Compliance Online 
- Full compliance is not a common things, websites may comply to the majority of laws and regulations but fail in order areas. 
- W3C, WAI, IDPF 
- percievables - must be presentable to users 
- operable - cannot require an interaction the user cannot be perform 
- Understand - must be intelligible 
- Robust - use it across different platforms 

Mobile Devices 

- Improper use of colour 
- Media not captioned 
- Sense bias 

- No coherent structure to content 
- Special scripting and/or plugins 
- Pointing devices required for interaction with contect 

- Non-plain language 
- Intent of interaction is unclear 
- Attention thieves 
- Non-systme agnostic 

### Social Contruction of Disabilty 
- Those who are different are not treated as equals 
- Differenlty abled implies that some of us do things in different ways. Thinking about it in this way undoes the binaries of able/disable. 
- Not every situation is appropriate for every person. 
- A lot of the time, things come down to POWER - we have a tendency to build things for people like ourselves 
- What is doing the disabling?
- To what extent does design also highlight our own failings?

Design - purpose+planning+intention 
- Decentralized at its base - open and accessible (diversity is important and should be part of the design process)
- Functional, convenient and reliable 
- Delightful - respecting human experience

**WAVE** - Web accessibiliy evaluation tool (put in url and it runs an audit)
- Press Books - don't work at the same time as someone else (post a note in slack)
- ProfHacker - posts and discussions about developments (accessibility)
- Make it accessible from the start- it's not easy to come back to your work 
- Inspecting the code allows you to see what's not working - you can make changes
