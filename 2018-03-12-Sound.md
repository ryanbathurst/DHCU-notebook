## Sound in the Digital Humanities 

### Random notes

- Bjork - "Crystalline" from *Biophilia* 
- Virus App - relationship between virus and cell - a kind of love story. 
- Temporal - need to let the virus die in order to hear the whole song. 
- Takes the professional out of the picture to a certain extent - less tied to the individual and more about the collective 
- The technology developer makes decisions about input and output but it is up to the user to make decisions about what music or sounds to piece together. 
- Generative music - computer based composition that is ever-different and changing. 
- Interplay between the system of representation and what emerges from that system. 
- Feedback - interaction between human and the interface 
- Sometimes the errors in interpretation can produce the more satisfying or human results. 
- Interesting to think about music as something that is measurable - you can't see it but you can visualize it. 
- Controlleerism - control over the technologies - manipulate it. 
- Archeology - if you are going to write about the past you should consider affect - it produces a different kind of engagement with the past. In addition to writing, introducing sound can really make it an immersive experience. 

Audio Tech person as the interface between the actual technologies and the music that is going to be played. The tech may come with a script but it is not always followed by the user.

- what meaning do we get from sound? 
- sometimes we can recognize what things sound right or wrong - the temporal narture of spoken word and music - we recognize progression. 
- associations beteen certain sound an emotion - their is a cultural and social element at play. 


- Schizophonia - splitting the sound from the maker of the sound - amplified and independent existence (vocals of a song issuing from a headphone) 

- Technological Determinism vs Social Construction of Technology 
- Muzak - effortless, passive, just kind of happens - in the context of the mall this helps to establish an atmosphere that encourages consumption. 
- Methods - cycles of stimulation (Think of christmas music) 
- Audio architecture - travel through hallways (low volume) - enter store (more immediate - hits)
- Writing sounds - communicating results (podcasts, soundscape...) - comes out of digital pedagogy (alternative assessment).
